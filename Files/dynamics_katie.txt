In this group I think we had a bit of communication issues in the beginning. 
We were not clear on the direction we wanted to take the code and it caused issues
 later on. But in the end we were able to find what worked well. We each would keep
  our coding separate and make sure that things always worked together in the end.
   We made sure that we each took time working on the code. We used things like discord 
   to allow someone to drive and the other to work through typing. We each gave our own 
   work to the assignment. Though some felt more leaned towards one person, we both made 
   sure of the understanding and having the ability to do the code. We reached for help
    when we needed it. I think we had our moments but in the end we worked ok together.
