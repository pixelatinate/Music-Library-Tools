    To be honest, I did significantly more of this project than Katie did. This
happened bc Katie didn't read the documentation as thoroughly as she should have, 
and we wasted a lot of time this week trying to write this problem with vectors. 
As a result, come Saturday it was really us realizing that we had hit a wall on 
what vectors are capable of, so I had to reach out to Clark Hathway to re-teach 
me about maps which meant I wrote, debugged, and rewrote most of this code on my
own. 
    What I will say is that Katie wrote the time recalculation section in the
print function. She also wrote some of the print function the night of Aug 28, 
so that when I woke up the next morning I could tell how much of our program was 
working. This did a lot to contribute to the positive attitude I took towards this
code for the rest of the day, which I think is pretty significant. 

The compile command is also included in the README, but here it is:
g++ -g -Wall -std=gnu++11 -o lib_info lib_info.cpp
